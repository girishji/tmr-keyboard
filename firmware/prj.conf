# --- 1. General Settings ---
CONFIG_GPIO=y
CONFIG_SERIAL=y

# --- 2. Debugging (RTT instead of UART) ---
CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y
CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=n
# Enable the shell over RTT for testing I2C/ADC manually
CONFIG_SHELL=y
CONFIG_SHELL_BACKEND_RTT=y

# --- 3. Analog Sensing (TMR Sensors) ---
CONFIG_ADC=y
CONFIG_ADC_NRFX_SAADC=y

# --- 4. I2C Bus (nPM1300 & LP5864) ---
CONFIG_I2C=y
CONFIG_NRFX_TWIM0=y
# NOTE: CONFIG_NRFX_TWIM0: The M stands for EasyDMA. This ensures that when you
# talk to your LED driver or PMIC, the data is moved via DMA, which keeps the
# CPU free.

# --- 5. Power Management (nPM1300) ---
CONFIG_MFD=y
CONFIG_MFD_NPM1300=y
CONFIG_REGULATOR=y
CONFIG_REGULATOR_NPM1300=y
# Enable charger support for battery monitoring via I2C
CONFIG_CHARGER=y
# NOTE: The CONFIG_MFD_NPM1300 is critical. Because the nPM1300 handles
# charging, regulators, and GPIOs all in one chip, Zephyr treats it as an
# "MFD." This setting allows the different drivers (charger, regulator) to
# share the same I2C communication channel.

# --- 6. LED Support (LP5864) ---
CONFIG_LED=y
# Note: If you write manual I2C code for LP5864, you don't strictly need 
# a specific LED driver config yet, but keeping LED=y helps for future drivers.

# --- 7. USB Support (For the Keyboard) ---
CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK=y
CONFIG_USB_HID=y
CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT="TMR Keyboard"
