there are 2 options (assuming built-in uf2 support is a must, for easy firmware installs and tweaks).

1) rp2040 -> straightforward, with qmk support. qmk has usb bugs and requires
   constant reboot (they use chibios monstrosity for usb, instead of built in
   stack), but it is easy to install and deal with.

2) seeed studio ble sense (with nrf52840). this also comes with uf2 (from
   adafruit). however there are not enough gpio pins to support adc expanders.
   for this use sipo like 74HC595 shift register.
