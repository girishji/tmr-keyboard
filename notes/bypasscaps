Q: for .1uf and .1nf bypass capacitors what package (0402 vs 0603) do you suggest

For a modern, high-performance chip like the **nRF54L15**, the choice between 0402 and 0603 is less about "hand-solderability" and more about **Parasitic Inductance** and **High-Frequency Performance**.

### 1. The Short Answer: Go with 0402
For a low-power, high-frequency BLE design using the nRF54L15, I strongly suggest using **0402 (1005 Metric)** packages for both the $0.1\mu\text{F}$ and $100\text{pF}$ ($0.1\text{nF}$) capacitors.

### 2. Why 0402 is better for this project

#### A. Lower Parasitic Inductance ($ESL$)
Bypass capacitors are there to "soak up" high-frequency noise. At the clock speeds and radio frequencies (2.4GHz) of the nRF54 series, the physical size of the component matters. 
* Smaller components (0402) have shorter internal paths and smaller solder pads.
* This results in lower **Equivalent Series Inductance ($ESL$)**. 
* High $ESL$ limits how fast the capacitor can respond to high-speed switching noise. 0402 outperforms 0603 in this regard.



#### B. Higher Self-Resonant Frequency ($SRF$)
The $100\text{pF}$ ($0.1\text{nF}$) capacitor is likely intended to filter very high-frequency noise or assist near the radio/DC-DC blocks. 
* A 0402 capacitor will have a higher **Self-Resonant Frequency** than a 0603. 
* Above the $SRF$, a capacitor actually starts behaving like an inductor and stops being useful for bypassing. You want your $SRF$ to be as high as possible.

#### C. PCB Real Estate
The nRF54L15 is a very small SoC. Using 0603 capacitors will force you to place them further away from the power pins.
* **The Golden Rule of Bypassing:** The effectiveness of a bypass capacitor is inversely proportional to its distance from the IC pin.
* 0402s allow you to pack the decoupling network extremely tight to the nRF54, which is critical for passing EMI/EMC testing.

### 3. Comparison Table

| Feature | 0402 (1005 Metric) | 0603 (1608 Metric) | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High-Frequency Performance** | Excellent ($Low\ ESL$) | Average | **0402** |
| **Placement Proximity** | Can be very close to IC | Requires more space | **0402** |
| **Hand Soldering** | Possible with tweezers/magnification | Very easy | **0603** |
| **DC Bias Effect** | Slightly more sensitive | Better (less capacitance loss) | **0603** |

### 4. A Note on "DC Bias"
One area where 0603 usually wins is the **DC Bias Effect** (where the effective capacitance drops as you apply voltage). However, at $1.8\text{V}$ or $3.3\text{V}$, the difference between a 0402 and 0603 for a $0.1\mu\text{F}$ capacitor is negligible. Just ensure you specify **X7R** or **X5R** dielectric rather than Y5V.

### Final Recommendation
* Use **0402** for all bypass caps ($0.1\mu\text{F}$ and $100\text{pF}$).
* If you are worried about hand-soldering, use a **"Long-Pad" 0402 footprint** in your PCB software; it makes it much easier to get the soldering iron tip onto the pad without losing the component.

**Would you like me to check the specific dielectric requirements (like NP0/C0G vs X7R) for your 100pF caps to ensure they are stable for the nRF54 radio?**

q: what abou 10uF caps?

For **10µF capacitors**, the decision is a bit more nuanced because of a phenomenon called the **DC Bias Effect**. 

In ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), the actual capacitance drops as the applied voltage increases. This effect is much more severe in smaller packages.

### 1. The Verdict: 0603 is safer, 0402 is possible
* **Recommended: 0603 (1608 Metric)**. This is the "sweet spot" for 10µF caps in a design like yours. It provides a good balance between physical size and "effective" capacitance.
* **Optional: 0402 (1005 Metric)**. Only use this if you are extremely tight on space and you select a capacitor rated for a much higher voltage than your circuit (e.g., a 10V or 16V rated cap for a 1.8V line).

---

### 2. Why 0603 wins for 10µF

#### A. The DC Bias Effect (Capacitance Loss)
High-density capacitors (high capacitance in a small volume) lose a significant amount of their "rated" value when voltage is applied.
* A **10µF 0402** capacitor at 3.3V might only provide **3µF to 4µF** of actual capacitance.
* A **10µF 0603** capacitor at 3.3V will typically retain **6µF to 8µF**.

If the nRF54L15 or nPM1100 datasheet specifically asks for 10µF for stability (especially for the Buck converter output), using an 0402 might leave you with too little "bulk" capacitance, leading to voltage ripples or instability.



#### B. Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR)
For bulk capacitors (like the 10µF used on the output of the nPM1100 Buck or LDO), you want a low but stable ESR. 0603 packages generally handle the ripple currents of a DC-DC converter better than 0402s without heating up or degrading.

### 3. Summary Comparison for 10µF

| Feature | 0402 (10µF) | 0603 (10µF) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Effective Capacitance** | Poor (drops significantly) | Good (drops moderately) |
| **Voltage Rating** | Usually max 6.3V or 10V | Easily available up to 16V or 25V |
| **Stability** | Risky for power regulators | **Reliable / Recommended** |
| **Ease of Assembly** | Difficult (very tall/thick) | Standard |

---

### 4. Critical Design Tip: Height Profiles
A 10µF capacitor in an 0402 package is often much "taller" than a standard 0.1µF 0402. This is called a **high-profile** component. If you are using automated pick-and-place or very thin keyboard cases, these "tall" 0402s can sometimes cause clearance issues or be easily knocked off the board. 0603s are more stable mechanically.

### Final Strategy for your PCB:
* **0.1µF and 100pF:** Use **0402** (Better high-frequency filtering).
* **10µF (Bulk/Decoupling):** Use **0603** (Better stability and effective capacitance).
* **Dielectric:** Always use **X5R or X7R**. Avoid Y5V or Z5U at all costs for this project.

**Would you like me to double-check the nPM1100's specific ESR requirements for the Buck converter output capacitor to make sure the 0603 you pick is compatible?**
