Pin	Connection
A9, B9	Tie together → nPM1100 VBUS
GND pins	All tied → GND
CC1	5.1 kΩ → GND
CC2	5.1 kΩ → GND

Why USB-C requires CC pins
A USB-C source will not turn on VBUS unless it sees:
A valid Rd on CC1 or CC2
A 2-pin connector:
Has no CC pins
So a compliant charger may never provide power
(Some “dumb” chargers always supply 5 V, but this is unreliable.)

- The Check: Ensure your MCU’s ADC pins are not configured with internal pull-ups. If they are, current will leak from the MCU into the unpowered TMR sensors, wasting battery and potentially giving you false readings when you switch banks.

- hard shutdown IS31FL3731 (SDB pin low), otherwise it uses >2mA even when LEDs
  are off (for better sleep current use LP5864 chip (supports 18x4=72 leds), but
  has higher min voltage requirements than IS31FL3731. However I2C needs to be
  reinitialized (after a brief delay after turning on SDB pin) by calling
  is31fl3731_init(). If you don't like this complication, use LP5864.
- get parts, try spi (adjusting clock if necessary)

You can use unipolar sensor, in which case offset is not necessary.

analog vs digital sensors

We show how a new tunneling magnetoresistance sensor can be used for perpendicular proximity sensing such as a keyboard switch.

Most keyboard switches are designed for Hall effect sensors, where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the sensor. But TMR sensors are preferred because of their precision.

Unlike Hall effect, TMR sensors are sensitive in the plane of the package. But with the small size and spacial precision of NVE sensors, we can use an off-axis perpendicular orientation. There's plenty of signal with no amplification. In this configuration the output is linear with distance over the four millimeter switch travel, rather than dropping off with the square of the distance in an in-plane configuration.

The sensor is just 1.1 mm square so it's ideal for precise proximity sensing. We mounted it on a circuit board under the switch. The sensor's low impedance and large output allows it connect directly to a microcontroller. We have a linear stepper motor for testing.

With an analog sensor, we can set the activate and release points with a comparator or in software. In this demo we used an Arduino and set constants for the activate and release points in software.

We can set it for standard thresholds, tight thresholds for Rapid-Trigger fast typing or gaming, or anywhere in between.

The sensors have best-in-class sensitivity and precision, large outputs and low impedance for direct interface to microprocessors, high speed for fast polling, and small packages.

Use a comparator:
A comparator is an electronic component that compares two analog input voltages
and produces a digital output signal to indicate which voltage is larger. It is
essentially a high-gain differential amplifier with a binary output that is
either a logic high or low. This makes it useful for tasks like measuring and
digitizing signals, such as in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), or for
creating simple switches, like turning a fan on when a temperature gets too
high.

The battery life is very good - I'm using full RGB and used it heavily for at
least 8 hrs a day, and it was lasting up to a week. But if you want to max it
out, turn off the RGB. It also decreases latency (RGB increases latency). Then
it can last even 2 weeks.

Now I'm testing a TMR with an 8000 mAh battery unit, and I can see it will be
doubled.

Sensors:

MDT TMR2617S
Programmed at:
	sensitivity: 0.7 mv/V/Gs
	offset voltage: 300 mV/V
Output:
	0.8v - 0V (when key pressed, when key is inserted it goes from 1v to .8v))
    (when magnet is reversed it goes from 1.3v to 2.5v)
NOTE: This is wrongly programmed, but still usable. Offset voltage should be
700 mv/V (or 500 mV/V if you don't want to worry about polarity).
sensitivity can be 0.5 mv/v/gs. when key is inserted it jumps ~0.2-0.3v.

MDT TMR2615 (1.6mm package)
Programmed at:
	sensitivity: 2 mV/V/Gs
	offset voltage: 300 mV/V
Output:
	1V - 0.75V (when key pressed)
NOTE: This is correctly programmed if (looking from above the switch), SMD is
orinted to the right of magnet with one pin above and 2 pins below. However
sensitivity can be increased further (or perhaps it can be moved a bit away from
magnet).

Should you choose MCP3208 B or C package?

C is half the price.

The MCP3208 family is offered in two accuracy classes: B and C. The datasheet
specifies INL = ±1 LSB for MCP3204/3208–B and INL = ±2 LSB for C.

At 12 bits an LSB = VREF / 4096. Example: with VREF = 3.3 V,
LSB ≈ 3.3 / 4096 ≈ 0.805 mV → ±1 LSB ≈ ±0.805 mV, ±2 LSB ≈ ±1.61 mV.

Raw ADC numbers (12-bit MCP3208, VREF = 3.3 V)
- LSB = VREF / 4096 = 0.000805664 V = 0.8057 mV.
- Counts across 0…0.8 V = 0.8 / 0.000805664 ≈ 993 counts.
- Counts per mm = 993 / 3.5 ≈ 283.7 counts/mm.
- Travel per count (1 LSB) = 3.5 / 993 ≈ 0.003525 mm ≈ 3.53 µm.

(So each ADC step corresponds to ~3.5 micrometres of key travel.)

Difference between B and C grades
- MCP3208–B INL spec ≈ ±1 LSB; –C ≈ ±2 LSB (typical datasheet split).
- The practical difference between B and C is therefore about 1 LSB (i.e. C can
  be ~1 LSB worse than B in worst case).
- 1 LSB = 0.8057 mV → in displacement that’s ~0.00353 mm = 3.53 µm.
- So B vs C worst-case difference ≈ ±3.5 µm (and C’s worst-case error could be
  ~±7 µm if you compare absolute limits).

3.5 µm (micrometres) is tiny compared with mechanical tolerances, key wobble,
switch spring hysteresis, sensor noise, connector tolerances and human
perception.

Choose C package.

Bypass capacitor for MCP3208

* “Bypass capacitor” (also called “decoupling capacitor”) is a small capacitor placed between the chip’s supply voltage pin (VDD) and ground (GND). Its job is to **filter out high-frequency noise** or transients on the power rail — preventing them from upsetting the ADC’s internal analog circuitry. ([Analog Devices][2])
* The bypass capacitor should go between **VDD** (power supply pin) and **ground**. ([DigiKey][1])
* Choose a small-value **ceramic capacitor** (e.g. 1 µF, X5R/X7R dielectric) — good for high-frequency decoupling.
* Connect the “–” side of the cap to the same ground net/plane that covers **both** the analog ground (AGND) and digital ground (DGND) of the MCP3208.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

For an M2 self-tapping screw (especially a fine one) in a typical ABS boss, the
threads will likely become significantly degraded, or the holding force
noticeably reduced, after:$$\text{**3 to 7 Re-insertions**}$$In critical
applications or where high clamping force is needed, designers will often assume
a maximum of 3 cycles to be safe. For non-critical panels, you might achieve 10+
cycles if extreme care is taken.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to minimize warping

✔ Clamp/weight the PCB flat during heating
Use a metal block, plate, or flat thick aluminum heat spreader underneath.

✔ Heat gradually rather than blasting one spot
Start with lower airflow or preheat the area.

✔ Preheat the board (optional)
If you have a preheater or hot plate, preheat to ~120–150 °C first, then use hot air. This reduces temperature gradients dramatically.

✔ Avoid heating large areas at once
Only heat the part you're soldering.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📐 Recommended Boss Diameter

General guidelines for boss design in ABS plastic recommend that the boss outer
diameter ($\mathbf{d_A}$) should be **2.0 to 2.5 times** the nominal outer
thread diameter ($\mathbf{d}$) of the screw or insert.

Since the **outer thread is M4** (nominal diameter $\mathbf{d} = 4.0 \text{
mm}$), the recommended minimum boss diameter is:

$$\text{Boss Outer Diameter} \approx 2.0 \times 4.0 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{8.0
\text{ mm}}$$

A safer, more robust boss would use the higher end of the range:

$$\text{Boss Outer Diameter} \approx 2.5 \times 4.0 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{10.0
\text{ mm}}$$

* **Best Practice Recommendation:** Design the boss outer diameter
  ($\mathbf{d_A}$) to be between **8.0 mm and 10.0 mm** for optimal strength and
  reduced risk of the boss cracking from the hoop stress created by the
  self-tapping action. 

---

## 🔩 Critical Design Parameters

In addition to the outer diameter, you must specify the correct inner hole
diameter and wall thickness:

### 1. Inner Pilot Hole Diameter ($\mathbf{d_H}$)

This is the diameter of the hole the M4 outer thread taps into. It must be
slightly smaller than the outer thread diameter but larger than the root (minor)
diameter of the thread.

* **Rule of Thumb:** $d_H \approx 0.8 \times d$ (nominal outer diameter). $$d_H
  \approx 0.8 \times 4.0 \text{ mm} = 3.2 \text{ mm}$$
* **Recommendation:** The pilot hole diameter ($\mathbf{d_H}$) should be
  approximately **3.2 mm** in ABS. Some sources suggest a range of $3.2 \text{
  mm}$ to $3.5 \text{ mm}$ depending on the exact material batch and thickness.

### 2. Boss Wall Thickness ($\mathbf{t}$)

The wall thickness of the boss should be strong enough to withstand the hoop
stress generated by the screw without cracking, but not so thick that it causes
sink marks in the surrounding plastic part.

* **Rule of Thumb:** Boss wall thickness ($\mathbf{t}$) is typically $40\%$ to
  $60\%$ of the nominal wall thickness of the plastic part, but must be strong
  enough for the screw.
* The thickness of the wall surrounding the hole is: $$\text{Wall Thickness} =
  (\text{Boss OD} - \text{Hole ID}) / 2$$ If you use the $8.0 \text{ mm}$ boss
  and $3.2 \text{ mm}$ hole: $$\text{Wall Thickness} = (8.0 \text{ mm} - 3.2
  \text{ mm}) / 2 = \mathbf{2.4 \text{ mm}}$$

The $2.4 \text{ mm}$ wall thickness provides adequate material to withstand the
radial stress from the M4 self-tapping thread.
