5. Recommendation: The "Safety Button"
Even if you use FOTA, always keep those physical SWD pads (Tag-Connect) on your board.

If you write a bug that crashes the Bluetooth stack (a "HardFault"), you won't be able to connect via Bluetooth to fix it.

The physical pads are your "Emergency Entrance" if the software gets bricked.

The "Tag-Connect" (Zero Height) - Best for Ultra-Thin
Instead of a connector, this uses a specialized footprint of gold pads and three tiny alignment holes on your PCB.

Height: 0.0 mm (It is just copper on your board).

The Cable: You buy a "Plug-of-Nails" cable (model TC2050-IDC-NL). One end has spring-loaded pogo pins that you press into the board; the other end is a standard 10-pin ribbon that plugs directly into your nRF54 DK.

Pros: No vertical space taken. You can place it directly under a keycap or between low-profile switches.

Cons: The cable is expensive (~$40), but you only need one for all your boards.

get 10 pin version: TC2050-IDC-NL : nRF54L15 DK has footprint for this.

Mandatory pins

Pin Name,    Description,    Purpose
SWDIO,    Serial Wire Data I/O,    The main bidirectional data line for debugging.
SWDCLK,    Serial Wire Clock,    The clock signal driven by the DK.
GND,    Ground,    Common reference between the DK and your board.
VDD​ (VTref),    Target Voltage,    Critical: The DK uses this to detect your board and match its logic levels (2.1V).
nRESET,    Hardware Reset,    "Allows the DK to force a ""Reset-and-Halt"" for reliable flashing."

Note: Some developers use a 6th pin (SWO) for high-speed logging/tracing, but for most nRF54L15 projects, printk over UART is more common.

For your low-profile keyboard and the **nRF54L15**, the **6-pin Tag-Connect** is actually the preferred choice over the 10-pin version.

Even though the DK has a 10-pin header, a 6-pin cable is better for your project for a few specific reasons:

###1. 6-Pin vs. 10-Pin: The Verdict* **You only need 6 pins:** The SWD protocol required to program the nRF54L15 only uses 5-6 signals: V_{DD} (VTref), SWDIO, SWDCLK, GND, nRESET, and optionally SWO.
* **Space Savings:** The 6-pin footprint (TC2030) is significantly smaller than the 10-pin (TC2050). On a crowded 72-sensor keyboard PCB, saving those extra square millimeters is vital.
* **The "Standard" for BLE:** Most Nordic developers use the 6-pin TC2030 for production and small prototypes.

###2. The Specific Cable You NeedYou cannot use a generic 6-pin Tag-Connect cable because the nRF54L15 DK has a 10-pin "micro" (1.27mm) connector. You need the version designed to bridge these two worlds:

* **Part Number:** **`TC2030-CTX-NL`** (The "NL" stands for No-Legs, which is best for your shallow keyboard case).
* **Why this specific cable?** * **Target side:** Tiny 6-pin "Plug-of-Nails" pogo pins.
* **Debugger side:** A small **10-pin 1.27mm female connector** that plugs directly into the **P19 (Debug Out)** header on your nRF54L15 DK.



###3. Footprint Comparison (PCB Impact)| Feature | TC2030 (6-Pin) | TC2050 (10-Pin) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Total Area** | **~21 mm²** | ~35 mm² |
| **Signal Usage** | VCC, SWDIO, SWDCLK, GND, RESET, SWO | Adds extra NC/GND pins you don't need |
| **Keyboard Fit** | Fits between most low-profile switches | Might require moving a switch |

###Important: Selection Filter in KiCadWhen you add the **TC2030-NL** footprint to your KiCad board:

1. **Alignment Holes:** The "No-Legs" version still has three tiny holes for alignment pins on the cable. Make sure no traces run through these holes.
2. **Solder Mask:** Ensure there is **no solder mask** on the 6 tiny pads. These are meant to be bare copper or ENIG (gold) finish so the pogo pins can make contact.
3. **The "Clip":** Since the NL version doesn't have legs to "snap" into the board, you have to hold it with your hand for 10 seconds while it flashes, or buy the "TC2030-CLIP" which acts like a tiny clothespin to hold the cable to your board.

###My Advice:Get the **TC2030-CTX-NL**. It connects your board to the DK perfectly, takes up the least amount of space on your 72-sensor matrix, and is the standard way to handle thin devices like yours.

**Would you like me to send you the specific Pin-to-Pad mapping for the TC2030 so you can double-check your KiCad wiring before you send the board to the fab?**

Yes, I am **100% sure**. Using a Nordic Development Kit (DK) to program a custom external board is the standard "professional" workflow. Nordic even calls this feature **"Debug Out."**

The nRF54L15 DK is specifically designed to act as a production-grade programmer for your custom PCB. Here is exactly how it works and what you need to do to ensure it succeeds:

###1. How the DK "Knows" to Program Your BoardThe DK has an onboard **Detection Circuit**.

* When you plug a cable into the **P19 (Debug Out)** header, the DK checks the voltage on **Pin 1 (VTref)**.
* If it detects voltage from your custom board (e.g., your **2.1\text{V}** rail), it automatically **disables** the nRF54L15 chip on the DK and redirects all programming commands to the P19 header.
* From your computer's perspective (in VS Code or nRF Connect), nothing changes—it just thinks it's talking to the DK, but the code actually goes into your custom keyboard.

###2. The "Short Cable" RuleBecause you are working with a 72-sensor matrix (which creates a lot of electrical noise) and a high-speed clock, **cable length is critical**.

* Keep your programming cable (the Tag-Connect or ribbon cable) **under 15cm (6 inches)**.
* If the cable is too long, the SWDCLK signal will degrade, and you will get "Failed to connect" errors.

###3. Essential Troubleshooting: `nrfutil device recover`The nRF54 series has very strict security. If you accidentally flash "bad" code that locks the debug port, or if the chip comes from the factory in a "Secure" state:

1. Open your terminal on your Mac.
2. Type: `nrfutil device recover --ids <DK_SERIAL_NUMBER>`
3. This forces the DK to "unbrick" your custom PCB by erasing the entire chip and resetting the security bits.

###Final Connection ChecklistBefore you order your PCB, double-check these five wires on your KiCad schematic:

| Signal | DK Pin (P19) | Tag-Connect Pad | Connection on your PCB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **VTref** | Pin 1 | Pad 1 | **Must connect to your +2.1V rail** |
| **SWDIO** | Pin 2 | Pad 2 | Connect to nRF54 SWDIO pin |
| **nRESET** | Pin 10 | Pad 3 | Connect to nRF54 nRESET pin |
| **SWDCLK** | Pin 4 | Pad 4 | Connect to nRF54 SWDCLK pin |
| **GND** | Pin 3 | Pad 5 | Connect to your Ground plane |
