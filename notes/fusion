autodesk fusion

- export kicad plate as step file
- import it in fusion
- insert the above model into a new design
- start a sketch and project the outlines
- remove all straight lines from outer end of the projected sketch leaving only arcs
- connect all the arcs to form the outer endge again (kicad disign has lots of short length lines that cause issues)
- make sure the shape is closed and you can extrude
- offset the outer endge and islands in the middle by 0.2mm (kicad pcb is 0.1mm smaller than the width of switch)
- offset the outer edge by the thickness of wall
- use the fillet tool generously to create rounded corners in the sky where needed
- build the wrist rest in sketch
- extrude everything and add small fillet around sharp endges (0.75mm)
