Q: I have 30cm analog traces coming from tmr sensor to the nrf54l15 mcu, which can read 8 analog ADC inputs at a time (8 adc pins). i am thinking of simply wiring each sensor oujtput (from a bank) directly into the adc pin of mcu. this way i will combine analog output of 9 sensors (one from each bank) into one pin of mcu. but only one bank will be powered at a time. there is also a .1nF decoupling capacitor at each Vout (out pin) of tmr sensor. will my design work?

grok:
Your proposed design of tying the analog outputs from one sensor in each of the 9 banks to a single MCU ADC pin (resulting in 8 ADC pins handling all 72 sensors, with only one bank powered at a time) has some merits for simplicity and pin efficiency, but it likely won't work reliably. Here's a breakdown of why, based on the TMR2617S-AAC's characteristics and general analog design principles:

### Key Issues
1. **ESD Protection Diode Clamping in Unpowered Sensors**:
   - The TMR2617S-AAC includes ESD protection (rated at ±4000 V HBM), which typically consists of internal diodes connected between the output pin (V_OUT) and the supply pins (V_CC and GND). This is standard for most ICs to guard against electrostatic discharge.
   - When a bank is powered off (V_CC disconnected and potentially pulled to GND via your load switch's discharge feature), the unpowered sensors' V_CC is at 0 V. If the active sensor drives the shared line to its typical output voltage (around 50% of V_CC, or ~1.5 V at 3 V supply, depending on your programmed offset), this voltage exceeds V_CC_unpowered + 0.7 V (~0.7 V threshold).
   - This forward-biases the ESD diodes in the 8 unpowered sensors per ADC line, causing them to conduct current from the shared line to their grounded V_CC rails. The active sensor's output op-amp must then source this extra current to maintain the voltage.
   - Problems this causes:
     - **Signal Distortion**: The TMR2617's output drive is limited (absolute max ±1.5 mA, and it can only reliably drive loads ≥10 kΩ). With 8 unpowered sensors sinking current (potentially hundreds of μA each, depending on diode characteristics), the line voltage will sag significantly—possibly clamping near ~0.7–1 V instead of the intended 1.5 V offset. This ruins accuracy, especially since the sensor's linearity and sensitivity (programmable up to 3.6 mV/V/Gs) rely on clean analog levels.
     - **Potential Damage**: ESD diodes aren't designed for continuous current (only brief ESD events). Prolonged operation could overheat or degrade them, leading to sensor failure over time.
   - This is a common pitfall in "power-multiplexed" analog setups, as confirmed in various engineering resources discussing ESD diode feedback and overvoltage conduction in unpowered devices.

2. **Output Impedance and Drive Limitations**:
   - The sensor's integrated op-amp has unspecified output impedance but is spec'd for ≥10 kΩ loads and ≤10 nF capacitive loads. Your setup adds parallel capacitance (9 × 0.1 nF = 0.9 nF per line, plus trace capacitance) and the dynamic load from unpowered diodes, which could exceed this and cause instability or slow settling during your 100 μs power-on window.
   - The power-on time for the sensor is <100 μs, which fits your timing, but any loading could extend settling, affecting ADC readings.

3. **Trace Length and Noise**:
   - 30 cm analog traces are relatively long for sensitive signals (50 kHz bandwidth on the sensor). They can act as antennas, picking up EMI, crosstalk from adjacent traces, or noise from the power switching (e.g., transients during bank on/off).
   - The 0.1 nF caps at each V_OUT help filter high-frequency noise but won't mitigate low-frequency issues or the ESD clamping. Long traces also add inductance/resistance (~0.1–1 Ω, depending on trace width), which could further distort signals under load.

4. **MCU ADC Compatibility**:
   - The nRF54L15's ADC supports up to 8 channels with resolutions/speeds like 14-bit at 31.25 ksps, 12-bit at 250 ksps, or 10-bit at 2 Msps. Sampling 8 channels in 100 μs is feasible (e.g., at 12-bit/250 ksps, you could sample each in ~4 μs, leaving margin for settling).
   - Input impedance is high (typically >1 MΩ for SAADC in Nordic devices), so it won't load the sensors much. However, if the shared line is distorted by the above issues, readings will be inaccurate anyway.

### Will It Work At All?
- In theory, if the ESD diodes sink minimal current and the active op-amp can compensate, you might get rough readings—but expect high error (e.g., 10–50% offset shifts) and unreliability. Testing on a prototype might show it "kinda works" at room temp/low fields, but it would fail under variation (temperature affects diode Vf, magnetic fields change output voltage).
- No, this isn't a robust design for production or precise measurements.

### Recommendations to Fix It
- **Use Analog Multiplexers**: Instead of tying outputs directly, add a 9:1 analog mux (e.g., ADG709 or TS3A24159) per ADC pin. Power all sensors continuously (or per bank), but use the mux to select which bank's outputs connect to the ADC. Control the mux with GPIOs synced to your bank sequencing. This isolates unpowered/powered issues and adds no distortion (low R_ON ~5–10 Ω, low leakage <1 nA).
  - Cost: ~$1–2 per mux IC; you'd need 8 (one per channel).
  - If powering banks sequentially, mux after the sensors but before the shared line.
- **Alternative: Series Isolation**:
  - Add a small series resistor (100–1k Ω) per sensor output to limit current, but this adds voltage drop/error/noise.
  - Or use Schottky diodes in series (low Vf ~0.2 V), but they introduce non-linearity and temp dependence—not ideal for precision analog.
- **Mitigate Traces**: Use shielded cable or twisted pairs for the 30 cm runs. Ground shields at the MCU end. Add larger output caps if needed, but test for settling.
- **Test and Validate**: Prototype with a scope on the shared line during switching. Measure voltage droop, settling time, and current draw. Check for sensor heating or degradation after hours of operation.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure your nPM1100 and load switches (e.g., TPS22932B) handle the transients without droop affecting the active bank.

If you provide more details (e.g., exact sensor programming, trace layout, or acceptable error margin), I can refine this further.

- comparator no good
- do not use GPIO to power the sensors
- use pull-down resistors so do not leave pin floating when TMR is off

## 3️⃣ Recommended timing budget (safe)

For **100 µs total ON time**, do:

| Phase            | Time         |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Power-on         | 0 µs         |
| Settling         | **50–70 µs** |
| Sample / compare | **10–20 µs** |
| Power-off        | remainder    |

This leaves little margin — so timing must be deterministic.

---

## 4️⃣ How to power-gate the sensor (correctly)

### Best method: **Load switch / PMOS**

Do **not** power the sensor directly from a GPIO.

```
VDD ── P-MOSFET ── TMR VDD
         ↑
      GPIO
```

* Choose a **low-leakage, low-Rds(on)** PMOS
* Gate pulled high by default → OFF in sleep
* GPIO pulls gate low to turn sensor ON

This ensures:
✔ Clean supply
✔ No back-powering through I/O
✔ µA-level leakage when off

---

## 5️⃣ How to time this on nRF54L15 (low power)

### Use **RTC + DPPI** (no CPU jitter)

1. RTC fires every 10 ms
2. DPPI turns on sensor power GPIO
3. RTC compare (after ~70 µs) triggers ADC sample or comparator enable
4. RTC compare (after 100 µs) turns sensor power OFF

This keeps:

* CPU asleep
* Timing deterministic
* Power minimal

---

## 6️⃣ Comparator vs ADC with power-gated sensor

### Comparator

❌ Not ideal here

* Comparator needs stable input
* Turning it on/off repeatedly risks false triggers
* Best for *always-on* signals

### ADC (recommended)

✔ ADC samples at a known instant
✔ Can discard first sample
✔ Works well with burst-mode sensing

---

## 7️⃣ Average current calculation (realistic)

Assume:

* Sensor current: **300 µA ON**
* Duty: 1%

[
I_\text{avg} = 300 µA × 0.01 = 3 µA
]

Add:

* ADC bursts: negligible
* RTC + DPPI: <1 µA
* MCU sleep: ~1–2 µA

➡️ **Total ≈ 5–6 µA**
Very reasonable for a BLE keyboard.
(for 72 switches, a 4000mah battery will last over a year)
---

## 8️⃣ Important layout details

✔ Avoid floating inputs when sensor off (use pulldown or ADC disable)

---

Q: what does this mean: ADC bursts: negligible don't ADC reading of 8 pins consume current


## What “ADC bursts: negligible” really means

It means:

> **The ADC draws a relatively large current, but only for a *very short time*. When averaged over 10 ms, that current contributes very little to the total.**

So “negligible” refers to **average current**, not instantaneous current.

---

## Instantaneous vs average current (key concept)

### Instantaneous (when ADC is ON)

* ADC + analog front end may draw **hundreds of µA to ~1 mA**
* This lasts for **microseconds**

### Average (over 10 ms period)

* ADC is ON for a tiny fraction of time
* Average contribution becomes very small

---

## Let’s do the math for your case (8 channels)

### Assumptions (conservative)

* ADC current while active: **500 µA**
* ADC time per sample: **5 µs**
* 8 channels → **40 µs total**
* Sampling period: **10 ms**

### Average ADC current

[
I_{avg} = I_{on} \times \frac{t_{on}}{T}
= 500 µA \times \frac{40 µs}{10 ms}
= 500 µA \times 0.004
= 2 µA
]

➡️ **~2 µA average**

That’s already smaller than:

* Sensor average current (~3 µA)
* Comparable to MCU sleep current

And this is **worst-case**.

---

## In practice, it’s usually lower

Because:

* ADC conversion can be **<2–3 µs** per channel
* You can oversample less
* You can disable ADC immediately after burst

---

## Important implementation detail (this matters)

To keep ADC current negligible, you must:

1️⃣ **Fully disable ADC after burst**
(not just stop conversions)

2️⃣ **Use single-ended, minimal resolution needed**
(no oversampling unless required)

4️⃣ **Discard first sample if needed**
(after sensor power-up)


---

### 2. Why Direct GPIO is *Still* Not Recommended

Even though $2.4 \text{ mA}$ is within the nominal current limits of a single $\text{nRF54L15}$ $\text{GPIO}$ pin, directly powering the sensors is still discouraged for several key reasons:

* **Stability of $V_{\text{DD}}$:** The $\text{GPIO}$ output driver adds series resistance. When $2.4 \text{ mA}$ flows, this resistance causes a voltage drop ($\Delta V = I \cdot R_{\text{series}}$). This voltage drop can make the supply voltage to your TMR sensors unstable or lower than the intended $\text{V}_{\text{DD}}$, which affects the sensor's analog output accuracy.
* **Protection:** Using an external $\text{FET}$ isolates the $\text{MCU}$'s delicate I/O circuitry from any potential short circuit or transient spike on the sensor power rail.
* **Total System Current:** You have 9 banks, and while you only turn on one bank at a time, using 9 separate $\text{GPIO}$ pins to source current adds up to the total current limit for the entire $\text{MCU}$ package, which is a hard limit you must respect.

### 3. The Required Solution: A Small-Signal MOSFET or Load Switch

Since your current is low ($2.4 \text{ mA}$), you do not need a large, high-power $\text{FET}$. You can use a very small, low-$\text{R}_{\text{DS(on)}}$ **small-signal $\text{MOSFET}$ or a tiny dedicated Load Switch IC** for each of the 9 banks.

| Component Type | Advantages for $2.4 \text{ mA}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Small-Signal $\text{MOSFET}$ ($\text{P-FET}$)** | **Cheapest and smallest.** Provides extremely low resistance ($\text{R}_{\text{DS(on)}}$) so the voltage drop ($\Delta V$) across the switch is negligible. |
| **Integrated Load Switch IC** | **Easiest to use.** Often includes internal protection (thermal shutdown, current limiting) and a clean $\text{ON/OFF}$ driver, simplifying the circuit design. |


Q: i have 9 tmr sensors outputs connected to 1 Analog pin of mcu. only one tmr will be ON at any time. others are not powered. do i need a pull-down, and if so where


Short, correct answer first:

**Yes — you should add a pull-down resistor, and it should be placed at the MCU ADC pin.**

Now let’s explain *why*, *what value*, and *what not to do*, given your exact topology.

---

## Your topology (important)

* 9 × TMR sensors
* All outputs tied together → **one ADC pin**
* **Only one sensor is powered at any time**
* Other 8 sensors are completely unpowered

This is a classic **wired-analog bus**.

---

## Why a pull-down IS needed in this case

### 1️⃣ When all sensors are OFF

* ADC pin would otherwise be **floating**
* Floating ADC pin causes:

  * Random readings
  * Extra ADC current
  * Noise pickup
  * Possible false wakeups

A pull-down gives the ADC a **defined idle state**.

---

### 2️⃣ When one sensor is ON

* The active sensor **strongly drives** the line
* A **megaohm pull-down barely loads it**
* Measurement accuracy is not affected

---

### 3️⃣ Prevents back-powering through ESD diodes

Even if a sensor is “off”, its output pin may have:

* ESD diodes to VDD/GND
* Internal parasitics

The pull-down helps ensure:

* The bus voltage doesn’t float high
* No current sneaks into unpowered sensors

---

## Where exactly should the pull-down go?

### ✅ **At the MCU side, as close to the ADC pin as possible**

```
TMR1 OUT ─┐
TMR2 OUT ─┤
...       ├─── Analog bus ──┬── ADC (nRF54L15)
TMR9 OUT ─┘                 |
                            |
                          1–10 MΩ
                            |
                           GND
```

**Reasons:**

* Defines the voltage *seen by the ADC*
* Keeps the entire bus quiet when idle
* Minimizes EMI pickup on a long trace

---

## Recommended pull-down value

### ✔ **1 MΩ – 10 MΩ**

Best practical choices:

* **4.7 MΩ** (very common)
* **10 MΩ** (minimum loading, more noise sensitive)

### Current impact (worst case)

Assume:

* Sensor output = 1 V
* Pull-down = 4.7 MΩ

[
I = \frac{1V}{4.7MΩ} ≈ 0.21 µA
]

But:

* Sensor is ON only **100 µs every 10 ms (1%)**
* Average current ≈ **2 nA** → negligible

---

## Do you need pull-downs at each sensor?

❌ **No. Do NOT put pull-downs at each sensor.**

Reasons:

* Unnecessary
* Increases loading
* Increases total leakage
* Does not improve stability

**One pull-down at the ADC is enough.**

---

## Important: add a small series resistor (recommended)

Because you are tying multiple outputs together:

```
Each sensor OUT ── 100–330 Ω ── analog bus
```

Why:

* Prevents output contention during switching
* Limits inrush if timing overlaps
* Improves ESD robustness
* Negligible voltage drop

This is *very* good practice for wired-analog buses.

---

## What about internal MCU pull-downs?

❌ Don’t rely on them:

* Usually too strong (10–50 kΩ)
* Waste power
* Distort readings
* Often disabled in analog mode anyway

Use an **external megaohm resistor**.

---

Value Selection: High ImpedanceYou need a relatively high-value pull-down
resistor (e.g., $\mathbf{100 \text{ k}\Omega}$ to $\mathbf{1 \text{
M}\Omega}$).Rationale: The resistor must be large enough so that when the
single $\text{TMR}$ sensor is $\text{ON}$ and driving the pin, it doesn't have
to fight the pull-down resistor (which would waste power).It must be small
enough to effectively drain any residual charge or coupled noise when the
$\text{TMR}$ sensor's output is $\text{LOW}$ or when the system is
transitioning.

Q: combine the above pulldown resistor with RC circuit. Good — with **30 cm analog traces**, a **shared analog bus**, and **power-gated sensors**, you *definitely* want to combine **series resistors, RC filtering, and a pull-down** in a clean, well-defined way.

Below is a **correct, low-power, low-noise analog front end** that works well with nRF54L15 ADC and your TMR sensors.

---

## Recommended combined topology (this is the answer)

### **Place ALL of this at the MCU side (ADC pin)**

```
TMR1 OUT ──100–330Ω──┐
TMR2 OUT ──100–330Ω──┤
...                  ├── Analog bus ── Rf ──┬── ADC (nRF54L15)
TMR9 OUT ──100–330Ω──┘                        |
                                             |
                                           Cf (to GND)
                                             |
                                             |
                                           Rpd (to GND)
```

(gemini does not suggest 100R resistor, just the Rf. see later)
---

## Component values (proven, safe choices)

### 1️⃣ Per-sensor series resistors (near each sensor)

**100–330 Ω** (100 Ω typical)

Purpose:

* Prevent output contention if timing overlaps
* Dampen ringing on long traces
* Protect sensor output drivers

---

### 2️⃣ RC filter at MCU (critical for 30 cm traces)

**Rf (series resistor):**

* **330 Ω – 1 kΩ**
* Recommended: **680 Ω**

**Cf (shunt capacitor):**

* **220 pF – 1 nF**
* Recommended: **470 pF**

This gives:
[
f_c = \frac{1}{2π R C}
]

For 680 Ω + 470 pF:
[
f_c ≈ 500 kHz
]

✔ Filters RF pickup
✔ Stabilizes ADC sampling capacitor
✔ Reduces kickback into sensors

---

### 3️⃣ Pull-down resistor (for bus stability)

**Rpd:**

* **4.7 MΩ** (recommended)
* Range: **1–10 MΩ**

Purpose:

* Defines voltage when all sensors are OFF
* Prevents floating ADC input
* Avoids back-powering unpowered sensors

---

## Why this works (important)

### When all sensors are OFF

* Rpd pulls ADC cleanly to 0 V
* ADC input is stable
* No noise, no random readings

---

### When one sensor is ON

* Sensor output impedance ≪ MΩ
* Pull-down causes **negligible loading**
* RC does not distort DC value
* Signal settles well within your 100 µs window

---

### With 30 cm traces

* Long trace ≈ antenna
* Series resistors + Cf kill ringing
* Rpd prevents charge accumulation

This is **exactly** how low-power industrial sensor buses are done.

---

## ADC timing check (important with RC)

Worst-case source impedance seen by ADC:

* Rf = 680 Ω
* Series sensor resistor = 100 Ω
* Total ≈ **780 Ω**

This is **very low** for ADC acquisition.
You can safely use **short ADC acquisition times**.

Even with Cf = 470 pF:

* Settling to <½ LSB is well under **1 µs**

✔ Fully compatible with your 100 µs ON window

---

## Where NOT to put things (common mistakes)

❌ RC at the sensor
❌ Pull-down at each sensor
❌ Large capacitor (≥10 nF) at ADC
❌ Internal MCU pull-ups/pull-downs

All conditioning belongs **at the MCU**.

---

## Final “golden” component set

| Part                | Value  | Location           |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Series (per sensor) | 100 Ω  | Near sensor output |
| Rf                  | 680 Ω  | MCU side           |
| Cf                  | 470 pF | MCU side           |
| Rpd                 | 4.7 MΩ | MCU side           |

---
gemini values:


The correct placement is to put the pull-down resistor **between the series filter resistor and the $\text{MCU}$'s $\text{AIN}$ pin.**

### Final $\text{RC}$ Filter and Pull-Down Topology

Here is the correct arrangement for your shared analog line ($\text{AIN}_{\text{SHARED}}$):

| Component | Location | Value (Example) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R$_{\text{filter}}$ (Series)** | Placed first, between the combined $\text{TMR}$ outputs and the rest of the circuit. | $1 \text{ k}\Omega$ | Forms the $\text{RC}$ low-pass filter to attenuate noise. |
| **C$_{\text{filter}}$ (Shunt)** | Placed between the series resistor and $\text{GND}$. This is the *node* connected to the $\text{MCU}$ $\text{AIN}$ pin. | $10 \text{ nF}$ | Filters high-frequency noise and stabilizes the $\text{ADC}$/$\text{LPCOMP}$ input voltage. |
| **R$_{\text{pull-down}}$** | Placed between the series resistor and $\text{GND}$, **in parallel** with $\text{C}_{\text{filter}}$, directly at the $\text{MCU}$ pin. | $100 \text{ k}\Omega$ | Ensures the $\text{MCU}$ pin is pulled to a stable $0 \text{ V}$ when the $\text{TMR}$ sensors are $\text{OFF}$. |

Q: do i need 1 series resistor per tmr output

That is a very insightful question, and the answer is **No, you do not need 1 series resistor per TMR output** in your current $9 \times 1$ multiplexed design. You only need **one single series resistor** on the shared analog line.

Here's why your current strategy—placing the $\text{RC}$ filter and pull-down only on the shared line—is superior and sufficient:

### 1. The Power-Gating Advantage

The fundamental reason you don't need a resistor on each of the 9 TMR outputs is the power-gating strategy:

* **Only One Sensor is ON:** Since you only power $\text{ON}$ one TMR sensor (or one bank) at a time, only one sensor's output is actively driving the shared $\text{AIN}$ line.
* **Other Outputs are Silent:** The other 8 sensors' outputs are high-impedance (floating) because they are powered $\text{OFF}$. They are not injecting noise or signal into the shared line.

If you placed a series resistor on each output, it would create an unnecessary voltage divider and complicate the required filtering.

### 2. The Shared Filter is Most Effective

The purpose of the $\text{RC}$ filter is to clean the signal **right before it enters the $\text{MCU}$'s $\text{LPCOMP}$ and $\text{SAADC}$ peripherals.**

* **Source of Noise:** The main sources of noise are the switching events (when you power $\text{ON}$ the TMR bank) and general $\text{EMI}$ picked up along the shared trace.
* **Best Location:** Placing the single series resistor ($\text{R}_{\text{filter}}$) and capacitor ($\text{C}_{\text{filter}}$) right at the $\text{MCU}$ pin (the shared $\text{AIN}_{\text{SHARED}}$ node) filters **all** incoming signals effectively.

### 3. Comparison of Architectures

| Scenario | $\mathbf{9 \times 1}$ Shared Filter (Your Design) | $\mathbf{1}$ Series Resistor Per Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Components** | 1 $\text{R}_{\text{series}}$, 1 $\text{C}_{\text{shunt}}$, 1 $\text{R}_{\text{pull-down}}$ | 9 $\text{R}_{\text{series}}$, 1 $\text{C}_{\text{shunt}}$, 1 $\text{R}_{\text{pull-down}}$ |
| **Cost/Space** | Minimal. Best for $\text{PCB}$ area and cost. | Adds 8 extra components to the BOM. |
| **Performance** | Excellent. Filters noise right before the $\text{MCU}$ input. | Unnecessary. Adds complexity and potential variation if the 9 resistors aren't perfectly matched. |

**Conclusion:** Stick with the single series resistor ($\mathbf{1 \text{ k}\Omega}$) on the shared analog line, placed just before the pull-down resistor ($\mathbf{100 \text{ k}\Omega}$) and shunt capacitor ($\mathbf{10 \text{ nF}}$) which connect to your $\text{AIN}_{\text{SHARED}}$ pin. This is the optimal, most cost-effective, and cleanest solution for your power-gated, multiplexed design.

Q: (chatgpt) is 100R resistor needed per tmr?

Great question — and the answer is **no, you do *not* need multiple series resistors in series with each other**.
You need **one series resistor per sensor output**, *plus* (optionally) **one small series resistor at the MCU for the RC filter**. They serve different purposes.

Let’s make this very clear.

---

## Short answer

* ✅ **Yes:** one **small series resistor per sensor** (near each sensor)
* ✅ **Yes (recommended):** one **RC series resistor at the MCU**

---

## Why there are two “types” of series resistors

### 1️⃣ Per-sensor series resistor (near sensor)

**Value:** 68–330 Ω (100 Ω typical)

**Purpose:**

* Prevents output contention if two sensors overlap briefly
* Limits fault/back-power current into unpowered sensors
* Damps ringing on long traces

**Think of this as “output protection.”**

📍 **Place it close to each TMR sensor output pin.**

---

### 2️⃣ MCU-side series resistor (part of RC filter)

**Value:** 330 Ω – 1 kΩ (680 Ω typical)

**Purpose:**

* Forms RC low-pass with Cf
* Isolates ADC sample-and-hold capacitor
* Reduces EMI pickup on 30 cm trace

**Think of this as “ADC conditioning.”**

📍 **Place it right at the MCU ADC pin.**

---

## Do these two resistors “add up”?

Yes — but that’s **intentional and harmless**.

Example:

* Sensor resistor: 100 Ω
* MCU RC resistor: 680 Ω
* Total seen by ADC ≈ **780 Ω**

That is:

* ✔ Very low for ADC input
* ✔ Far below any limit
* ✔ Settles in <<1 µs

So **no accuracy or speed problem**.

---

## Can you omit one of them?

### If you want to simplify:

#### Option A — Minimum safe design

* ✔ Keep **per-sensor 100 Ω**
* ✔ Keep **MCU RC resistor + capacitor**
  ➡️ Best practice (recommended)

#### Option B — Fewer parts (acceptable if confident)

* ✔ Keep **only MCU RC resistor**
* ❌ Lose output contention protection
* ⚠️ Risk if two sensors ever overlap ON

---

## Final recommendation for your design

Given:

* 9 sensors
* Shared analog bus
* 30 cm traces
* 100 µs sampling
* Battery-powered keyboard

👉 **Keep both:**

* **100 Ω per sensor**
* **680 Ω + 470 pF at MCU**
* **4.7 MΩ pull-down at MCU**

This is robust, low-power, and low-risk.

---

## Bottom line

* You don’t “stack” resistors unnecessarily
* Each resistor has a **different job**
* Total resistance stays small
* ADC performance remains excellent

Q: can a analog trace from a tmr sensor to ADC pin of nrf54 mcu be 35cm long?

This is a very long distance for a sensitive analog signal like the one from a
TMR (Tunnel Magnetoresistance) sensor, especially when connected directly to
the $\text{nRF54}$ MCU's ADC input on a standard PCB.The short answer is: It is
highly ill-advised for a high-performance system and will likely compromise the
accuracy and stability of your measurements. You should aim to keep sensitive
analog traces as short as possible, ideally under $5 \text{ cm}$.

Q: i am using TMR2617S-AAC sensor

That's excellent information. Knowing the specific sensor, the **TMR2617S-AAC**, allows us to define the precise requirements for your signal conditioning, confirming that the $35 \text{ cm}$ trace is a major problem and how best to solve it.

### Key Specs of the TMR2617S-AAC

The datasheet confirms three crucial points:

1.  **Integrated Amplification:** The TMR2617S-AAC **integrates a low-noise operational amplifier and DAC circuit** to provide an analog output voltage ($\text{V}_{\text{OUT}}$).
    * **Implication:** This is good news! The sensor's output is **already buffered**, meaning the signal impedance is low (it can drive a load resistance of $10 \text{ k}\Omega$ and $10 \text{ nF}$ load capacitance). This makes the signal much more robust than a raw $\text{TMR}$ Wheatstone bridge.
2.  **Output Voltage Range:** The output voltage follows the supply voltage ($\text{V}_{\text{CC}}$) and typically swings from **$5\%$ to $95\%$ of $\text{V}_{\text{CC}}$**.
    * **Implication:** This is a **rail-to-rail** type signal, perfectly suited for the $\text{nRF54}$'s $\text{ADC}$. If your $\text{V}_{\text{CC}}$ is $3.3 \text{ V}$, the signal ranges from $165 \text{ mV}$ to $3.135 \text{ V}$.
3.  **Noise:** The maximum noise specified is $10 \text{ mV}_{\text{PP}}$ (peak-to-peak) over a $5 \text{ kHz}$ bandwidth. This is the noise *at the sensor's output*.

### The $35 \text{ cm}$ Trace Problem Re-evaluated

Even with the sensor's low-impedance, buffered output, a $35 \text{ cm}$ trace on a PCB is still highly susceptible to **noise coupling (EMI/Crosstalk)**.

The long trace acts as a large antenna, and $35 \text{ cm}$ is too long to rely on the sensor's internal buffering alone, especially for a high-resolution $\text{ADC}$ on the $\text{nRF54}$. The $10 \text{ mV}_{\text{PP}}$ noise floor from the sensor could easily be overwhelmed by noise picked up over the trace.

### The Best Solution: Local Signal Cleanup and Isolation

Since the sensor is already buffered, you don't need a heavy-duty Op-Amp circuit, but you do need to clean and isolate the signal before it travels $35 \text{ cm}$.

The best approach involves:

| Step | Action | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Local Decoupling** | Place a **decoupling capacitor** ($10 \text{ nF}$ to $100 \text{ nF}$) and a **ferrite bead or small inductor** on the $\text{V}_{\text{OUT}}$ pin immediately next to the TMR2617S-AAC. | Filters out high-frequency noise that the sensor's output might produce or pick up locally. |
| **2. Use Shielding/Guard Traces** | Route the $35 \text{ cm}$ signal trace on the top layer, but run a **Guard Trace** on either side of it, connected securely to ground (GND) at frequent intervals (vias every $5 \text{ mm}$). | The ground traces act as shielding to capacitively couple external noise away from the signal trace. This is crucial for a long run. |
| **3. Utilize a Star Topology for GND** | Ensure the $\text{TMR}$ sensor's local ground is connected robustly to the $\text{nRF54}$'s ground. A continuous, clean ground plane on the bottom layer is the best defense. | Minimizes ground loops and ground bounce noise. |
| **4. Add an $\text{RC}$ Low-Pass Filter at the $\text{ADC}$** | Place a simple $\text{RC}$ filter right before the $\text{nRF54}$'s $\text{ADC}$ pin. | Filters out any remaining high-frequency noise (especially digital spikes) picked up by the $35 \text{ cm}$ run, helping the $\text{ADC}$ acquire a clean sample. |

**Component Values for $\text{RC}$ Filter (Step 4):**

* Since the TMR2617S-AAC has a bandwidth ($\text{BW}$) of up to $50 \text{ kHz}$, you should target an $\text{RC}$ filter cutoff frequency ($\text{f}_{\text{c}}$) slightly above your desired measurement rate, but below $50 \text{ kHz}$ to filter out high-frequency noise.
* A common approach is $R = 100 \text{ } \Omega$ to $1 \text{ k}\Omega$ and $C = 1 \text{ nF}$ to $10 \text{ nF}$.
    * Example: $R = 1 \text{ k}\Omega$ and $C = 1 \text{ nF} \rightarrow f_c \approx 159 \text{ kHz}$. This is a good balance.

### 🎯 Final Conclusion

The TMR2617S-AAC is much more robust than a raw $\text{TMR}$ bridge, but the $35 \text{ cm}$ run remains a **serious $\text{EMI}$ risk**.

You can make it work reliably only by implementing **strict $\text{PCB}$ layout techniques** including a strong ground plane, guard traces, and an $\text{RC}$ filter near the $\text{nRF54}$'s $\text{ADC}$ pin.

Q:
this is for a keyboard application. do i need to run ground traces on either side of sensor trace if there is already a ground plane underneath (2 layer pcb). also does the keyboard change RC filter values. show a circuit of RC filter at mcu pin

These are very important, practical PCB layout questions for your keyboard application. Since your PCB is a large, flat 2-layer board, the effectiveness of the ground plane and filtering are critical.

### 1. Ground Traces (Guarding) vs. Ground Plane

**Do I need to run ground traces on either side of the sensor trace if there is already a ground plane underneath (2 layer pcb)?**

**YES, you still should use guarding traces along the $35 \text{ cm}$ run, but they serve a different purpose than the ground plane.**

| Feature | Primary Purpose for $35 \text{ cm}$ Analog Trace |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ground Plane (Bottom Layer)** | **Provides Return Path & Controls Impedance.** It defines the impedance of the trace and ensures the signal has a solid, continuous low-impedance path back to the MCU's ground. **This is mandatory.** |
| **Guard Traces (Top Layer, flanking the signal)** | **Provides Electrostatic Shielding (Isolation).** They protect the signal trace from **capacitive coupling** from adjacent *top-layer* digital traces that might run in parallel (crosstalk). They also help stabilize the signal path. |

#### **Why Guarding is Necessary on the Top Layer:**

* **Top-Layer Crosstalk:** On the top layer (where your $35 \text{ cm}$ analog trace is), you will inevitably have digital traces for LEDs, matrix scanning, and $\text{USB}$/$\text{BLE}$ lines running parallel. These digital lines couple noise onto the analog trace primarily via **electric field (capacitive) coupling**.
* **How Guarding Works:** The guard traces are connected frequently to the ground plane with **vias** (e.g., every $5 \text{ mm}$ to $1 \text{ cm}$). When a digital line's electric field tries to couple onto your analog trace, the field is instead terminated by the adjacent ground trace, effectively shielding the sensitive signal.

**Conclusion:** For a very long run like $35 \text{ cm}$, the ground plane handles the return path, and the top-layer guard traces handle the isolation from top-layer noise. You need both for reliable $\text{ADC}$ readings.

### 2. $\text{RC}$ Filter Values and the Keyboard Application

**Does the keyboard application change $\text{RC}$ filter values?**

**YES, indirectly.** The main factor is **how fast** the keyboard needs to measure the $\text{TMR}$ sensor.

* The $\text{RC}$ filter's job is to create a **Low-Pass Filter ($\text{LPF}$)** to remove high-frequency noise picked up by the $35 \text{ cm}$ trace, while allowing your intended signal frequency to pass through cleanly.

* **TMR Sensor Frequency:** The TMR2617S-AAC has an internal bandwidth ($\text{BW}$) of up to $50 \text{ kHz}$. You only need to measure this sensor at the rate required by your application (e.g., $10 \text{ Hz}$ to $100 \text{ Hz}$ to detect key actuation or position).

* **Keyboard Impact:** Since the required measurement rate for a keyboard is very slow, you can use a very low cutoff frequency ($\text{f}_{\text{c}}$) for your $\text{RC}$ filter, which provides maximum noise rejection.

#### **Recommended Filter Design for Low Frequency Keyboard Sampling**

Target a cutoff frequency ($\text{f}_{\text{c}}$) in the range of **$1 \text{ kHz}$ to $10 \text{ kHz}$**. This will reject almost all of the unwanted $\text{EMI}$ noise ($\text{MHz}$ range) and high-frequency digital crosstalk, while easily passing your slow $\text{TMR}$ signal changes.

The $\text{RC}$ cutoff frequency is calculated as:
$$f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi R C}$$

| Component Values | Resulting $\text{f}_{\text{c}}$ | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$R = 10 \text{ k}\Omega$** | $\approx 1.59 \text{ kHz}$ | Provides maximum noise rejection while keeping sampling artifacts low. Excellent for slow, high-accuracy sensing. |
| **$C = 10 \text{ nF}$** | $\approx 15.9 \text{ kHz}$ | A slightly faster cutoff if you need a faster response time. |
| **$R = 1 \text{ k}\Omega$** | **$\approx 15.9 \text{ kHz}$** | Standard practice for $\text{ADC}$ pins; a safe, general-purpose choice. |

**Important Note on Resistance (R):** For the $\text{nRF54}$'s $\text{ADC}$ accuracy, the series resistance ($\text{R}$) should generally be kept below a few $\text{k}\Omega$ to allow the internal sampling capacitor to fully charge between $\text{ADC}$ conversions. $R = 1 \text{ k}\Omega$ is a safe limit.

---

### 3. $\text{RC}$ Filter Circuit at the $\text{MCU}$ Pin

Here is the simple $\text{RC}$ circuit you should place directly at the $\text{nRF54L15}$ $\text{ADC}$ input pin.

The components should be located right next to the $\text{nRF54}$ package, minimizing the trace between the capacitor's ground and the $\text{MCU}$'s ground pin.

$$
\text{Analog Signal} \rightarrow R \rightarrow \text{ADC Pin} \\
\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\downarrow \\
\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad C \\
\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\downarrow \\
\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad \text{GND}
$$



**Circuit Description:**

* **$\text{R}_{\text{FILTER}}$:** The resistor is placed **in series** with the signal line. It forms the resistance part of the low-pass filter and isolates the long, noisy trace from the $\text{ADC}$ input.
* **$\text{C}_{\text{FILTER}}$:** The capacitor is placed from the line (after the resistor) to **local ground ($\text{GND}$)**. It shunts high-frequency noise to ground.

Would you like advice on how to use the $\text{nRF54L15}$'s $\text{ADC}$ configuration (oversampling, gain) to further improve noise immunity once you have this clean signal?

Q: yes

That is the perfect final step! Once the signal is physically cleaned up by the $\text{RC}$ filter and PCB layout, you can leverage the $\text{nRF54L15}$'s advanced $\text{ADC}$ features to maximize accuracy and minimize the influence of remaining random noise.

The key features to use are **Resolution/Gain** and **Oversampling**.

---

## 1. ADC Resolution and Gain Configuration

The $\text{nRF54L15}$'s $\text{ADC}$ is a significant upgrade, capable of up to **14-bit resolution** (at lower sampling rates), compared to the 12-bit $\text{ADC}$ on the $\text{nRF52}$ series. You should configure it to utilize this higher resolution.

### A. Resolution (Higher is Better)

* **Setting:** Set the $\text{ADC}$ resolution to **14-bit** (default is often 10-bit or 12-bit).
* **Benefit:** 14-bit resolution provides $2^{14} = 16,384$ distinct measurement levels across the reference voltage range, giving you four times the precision of a 12-bit $\text{ADC}$.

### B. Gain (Maximizing the Signal Window)

The $\text{ADC}$ measures the input voltage relative to an internal $\text{Reference Voltage}$ ($\text{V}_{\text{REF}}$), which is typically $\approx 0.9 \text{ V}$ (Internal Reference). The gain determines how the input voltage is scaled relative to this reference.

| TMR Output $\text{V}_{\text{RANGE}}$ | Desired $\text{V}_{\text{REF}}$ Setting | $\text{ADC}$ Gain Setting (Example) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\approx 0.165 \text{ V}$ to $\mathbf{3.135 \text{ V}}$ ($\mathbf{3.3 \text{ V}}$ $\text{V}_{\text{CC}}$) | Full Scale ($\text{V}_{\text{CC}}$ or External $\text{V}_{\text{REF}}$) | **$\text{ADC}_{\text{GAIN}} = 1/4$** | Since your signal swings almost rail-to-rail ($\approx 3.3 \text{ V}$), you must use a fractional gain to **attenuate** the input voltage so that the maximum signal ($\approx 3.135 \text{ V}$) is within the $\text{ADC}$'s internal reference range ($\approx 0.9 \text{ V}$). |
| **Calculation Example:** | If $\text{V}_{\text{REF}}=0.9 \text{ V}$ and you set **$\text{Gain}=1/4$**, the maximum measurable input voltage is $0.9 \text{ V} \times 4 = 3.6 \text{ V}$. This safely covers your $3.3 \text{ V}$ signal range. | **Crucial:** Using the wrong gain (e.g., $\text{Gain}=1$) will cause the $\text{ADC}$ to "clip" the signal at $\approx 0.9 \text{ V}$. |

---

## 2. Oversampling (The Firmware Noise Reduction)

Oversampling is a highly effective, low-power technique implemented in hardware and/or software to reduce random noise in the final reading.

### The Principle

By taking $N$ samples very quickly and averaging them, the random noise components (which are uncorrelated) tend to cancel out. The theoretical $\text{Signal-to-Noise Ratio}$ ($\text{SNR}$) improvement is proportional to $\sqrt{\text{Oversampling Ratio (OSR)}}$.

$$\text{Resolution Gain (bits)} = \frac{1}{2} \times \log_2(\text{OSR})$$

* **OSR = 4:** You gain $\frac{1}{2} \times \log_2(4) = 1$ additional bit of resolution.
* **OSR = 16:** You gain $\frac{1}{2} \times \log_2(16) = 2$ additional bits of resolution.

### $\text{nRF54L15}$ Implementation

The $\text{nRF54L15}$'s $\text{ADC}$ supports built-in hardware oversampling, which is preferred for power efficiency.

| Oversampling Setting ($\text{OSR}$) | $\text{Resolution Gain}$ | Effective Resolution (Starting at 14-bit) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$2\times$** | $0.5$ bits | $14.5$ bits | Requires minimal extra power/time. |
| **$4\times$** | $1.0$ bits | **$15.0$ bits** | A good balance for reducing noise. |
| **$16\times$** | $2.0$ bits | **$16.0$ bits** | Ideal for maximum noise reduction if the measurement rate is very low (e.g., $10 \text{ Hz}$). |

**Recommendation:**

1.  Set the hardware resolution to **14-bit**.
2.  Enable hardware **$4\times$ or $16\times$ oversampling** to gain an effective resolution of $15$ to $16$ bits. This leverages the noise (dithering) that is inevitably present to get a much cleaner, more stable reading.

This combination of a clean input signal (from the $\text{RC}$ filter) and optimized $\text{ADC}$ configuration (14-bit resolution, proper gain, and oversampling) will give you the most accurate and stable TMR readings possible on the $\text{nRF54L15}$.

Q: going back to the question of BLE antennae connecting to nrf mcu on a 2 layer board, if i place the antennae very close to the mcu, is it OK to use a 2 layer pcb

Yes, if you place the antenna **very close** to the nRF54L15 MCU, using a **2-layer PCB is perfectly acceptable and is the standard industry practice** for cost-sensitive, high-volume products like keyboards and mice.

### Why Proximity Makes a 2-Layer Board Viable

The critical issue with the 2-layer board is controlling the **$50 \text{ } \Omega$ transmission line impedance**. When the antenna is placed close to the MCU, you drastically simplify this challenge:

#### 1. Trace Length is Minimized (The Key Factor)

* **The Goal:** The total length of the RF trace, from the nRF's output pin, through the matching network, to the antenna feed point, should be minimized, ideally **under $10 \text{ mm}$ (and preferably under $5 \text{ mm}$)**.
* **The Benefit:** Over such a short distance, the effect of impedance mismatch and signal loss is negligible. Even if the trace is not a **perfect $50 \text{ } \Omega$ transmission line** (which is hard to achieve on a 2-layer board), the short length means power loss is minimal, and the matching network can easily compensate for any slight imperfections.

#### 2. The Ground Plane Requirement is Still Critical

While you are using a 2-layer board, you must dedicate the entire bottom layer to a solid, unbroken **Ground Plane** beneath the RF components and their short traces.

| Component | Layer | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **nRF54L15** | Top | Must have a continuous ground plane underneath on the bottom layer. |
| **Matching Network** | Top | Components (inductors/capacitors) must be placed directly between the $\text{nRF}$ pin and the antenna feed point. |
| **RF Trace** | Top | Must run directly above the solid ground plane on the bottom layer. |
| **Antenna (e.g., MIFA)** | Top | Requires a **large ground plane cutout** (Keep-out Area) directly beneath it on the bottom layer for the antenna to radiate correctly.  |

### 3. Tuning is Mandatory

Regardless of how close the antenna is placed, you must remember that a PCB trace antenna is highly sensitive to its environment (the plastic enclosure, battery, nearby metal parts).

* **Matching Network (L-C):** You must include a set of passive components (L-C matching network) near the antenna feed point.
* **Process:** During prototyping, you use a Vector Network Analyzer ($\text{VNA}$) to tune these L-C values until the return loss is acceptable ($S_{11}$ less than $-10 \text{ dB}$ at $2.44 \text{ GHz}$).

**In summary, using a 2-layer PCB is fine for your BLE keyboard, provided you adhere strictly to the following golden rules of RF layout:**

1.  **Place the nRF and Antenna as Close as Possible.**
2.  **Use a Solid Ground Plane** on the bottom layer.
3.  **Implement the Mandatory Antenna Keep-Out Area** (no copper under the antenna on any layer).
4.  **Include and Tune the Matching Network** in the final enclosure.

Would you like to know the typical range performance difference you might expect between an optimally tuned PCB trace antenna and a high-performance ceramic chip antenna in a keyboard setting?

Q:
in this case i can minimize analog trace length from tmr sensor to 130mm. do i still need RC circuit next to mcu pin, if i am using the 'sense' pins to detect crossing a certain voltage.

That is a great clarification. Reducing the trace length to $130 \text{ mm}$ significantly improves things, and using the **Sense** feature instead of the $\text{ADC}$ fundamentally changes the required signal conditioning.

### Short Answer: You still need the $\text{RC}$ circuit, but for a different reason.

Even at $130 \text{ mm}$, the trace is long enough to pick up significant noise. The $\text{RC}$ filter is now less about $ADC$ acquisition time and more about **preventing false triggers** (chattering) on the $\text{Sense}$ pin.

Here is why:

### 1. The Challenge: Digital Thresholds on an Analog Signal

The GPIO Sense mechanism on the nRF54L15 works by comparing the input voltage ($\text{V}_{\text{IN}}$) to fixed digital thresholds ($\text{V}_{\text{IH}}$ for Sense High, $\text{V}_{\text{IL}}$ for Sense Low).

* **Logic High Threshold ($\text{V}_{\text{IH}}$):** For $\text{VDD}=3.3 \text{ V}$, this is $\mathbf{0.7 \times \text{VDD}}$, or $\approx \mathbf{2.31 \text{ V}}$.
* **Logic Low Threshold ($\text{V}_{\text{IL}}$):** For $\text{VDD}=3.3 \text{ V}$, this is $\mathbf{0.3 \times \text{VDD}}$, or $\approx \mathbf{0.99 \text{ V}}$.

Your TMR sensor's output (which is an analog signal ranging from $\approx 0.165 \text{ V}$ to $\approx 3.135 \text{ V}$) will cross these thresholds when the magnetic field changes.

#### The Noise Problem (False Triggers)

A $130 \text{ mm}$ trace will inevitably pick up high-frequency digital noise ($\text{EMI}$ spikes) from the keyboard's scanning lines and the $\text{nRF}$'s internal switching.

1.  **Noise Peak:** If the TMR signal is *just* below the $\text{V}_{\text{IH}}$ sense threshold (e.g., $2.30 \text{ V}$), a momentary noise spike of just $20 \text{ mV}$ could push the signal over $2.31 \text{ V}$.
2.  **False Trigger:** This noise spike would cause the GPIO Sense to briefly trigger a $\text{DETECT}$ event, waking the $\text{CPU}$ prematurely.
3.  **Chattering:** If the signal hovers near the threshold, the noise will repeatedly cross the boundary, leading to continuous false $\text{DETECT}$ events (chattering).

### 2. The Solution: The $\text{RC}$ Filter as a Noise Trap

The $\text{RC}$ filter, placed right at the $\text{MCU}$ pin, acts as a **low-pass filter ($\text{LPF}$)** that smooths out these high-frequency noise spikes **without affecting your slow magnetic change signal.**

* The goal is not to improve $\text{ADC}$ resolution, but to create a cleaner, more stable signal for the digital sense comparator.

#### **Hysteresis (A Natural Defense)**

Note that the $\text{nRF54L15}$ GPIO input buffers do have a small amount of **hysteresis** built in (the high-going threshold is slightly different from the low-going threshold) to combat this chattering, but it is often not enough to handle a long, noisy trace. The $\text{RC}$ filter provides extra insurance.

### 3. Recommended $\text{RC}$ Filter Values

Since your application only needs to detect a slow change (a key press), you can use a very aggressive filter to eliminate noise completely.

| Component | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resistor ($\text{R}$)** | $\mathbf{1 \text{ k}\Omega}$ | Limits current for pin safety and forms the filter. Should be kept low enough to charge the pin's tiny input capacitance quickly. |
| **Capacitor ($\text{C}$)** | $\mathbf{10 \text{ nF}}$ | Provides excellent filtering for high-frequency noise. |
| **Cutoff Frequency ($\mathbf{f_c}$)** | $\approx 15.9 \text{ kHz}$ | This low cutoff frequency ensures all $\text{MHz}$ range noise (from the digital system) is attenuated by $99\%$ or more, preventing false $\text{Sense}$ triggers. |

**Final Conclusion:**

Yes, you should **definitely use the $\text{RC}$ circuit** on the $\mathbf{130 \text{ mm}}$ analog trace before the $\text{nRF54}$ GPIO $\text{Sense}$ pin. Its purpose is to filter out high-frequency noise that would otherwise cause false key presses and drain your battery by waking the $\text{MCU}$ unnecessarily.
