For coders/writers Space key the most used.
Then Enter and Backspace.

Based on key press frequency data from a developer's logging study
(representative of the "coder/writer" category):

The difference in usage is **50%**.

This means that the **Enter/Return** key was pressed 50\% more often
than the **Backspace** key in that dataset.

-----

### Calculation Breakdown

The percentage difference is highly dependent on the individual user's habits, programming language, and writing style. Using one recorded developer's statistics for comparison:

| Key | Recorded Presses |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enter / Return** | 9,000 |
| **Backspace** | 6,000 |

1.  **Difference in presses:** $9,000 - 6,000 = 3,000$
2.  **Percentage difference (relative to Backspace):**
    $$
    $$
    $$
    $$
    \\frac{\\text{Enter} - \\text{Backspace}}{\\text{Backspace}} \\times 100% = \\frac{3,000}{6,000} \\times 100% = \\mathbf{50.0%}
    $$

### Why Enter is Used More by Coders/Writers

While Backspace is a top-three key for general typing, **Enter** often pulls ahead in professional text-heavy work because it serves multiple critical functions beyond just starting a new paragraph:

  * **Code Structure:** In programming, Enter is required to create a new line after almost every statement or code block (`if`, `for`, etc.).
  * **Command Execution:** It executes commands in terminals or IDEs.
  * **Autocompletion:** It is often used to **accept an autocomplete suggestion** from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is a common action that may not involve any text output.
  * **Writing/Editing:** It separates paragraphs in prose or creates new bullet points in lists.
