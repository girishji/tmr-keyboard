### 2. The Nut and ABS Thickness

You have a **3mm thick ABS bottom** and a **2mm tall M2 nut**.

* **The Problem (The "Punch-Through"):** When you heat-insert a 2mm nut into a 3mm wall, you only have **1mm of plastic** remaining at the bottom of the hole. ABS is a soft thermoplastic; if you apply too much heat or pressure during installation, the nut can easily "punch through" or cause a visible bulge (witness mark) on the exterior of your CNC case.
* **The Solution:** * **Pre-drill Depth:** Ensure your CNC hole is exactly 2.1mm or 2.2mm deep, leaving that 0.8mm–0.9mm "floor" intact.
* **Low Heat:** Set your soldering iron to about **250°C** for ABS.
* **Counter-Bore:** If possible, insert the nut from the **bottom** ("pull-style"). This way, when you tighten the screw, you are pulling the nut *into* the case rather than pulling it *out* of the plastic.
